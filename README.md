# Retrocomputing resources about Global Change

Awareness about ongoing global change emerged  from the 1970’s. It led to the use of computer to build 
and simulate a variety of global models focusing or combining aspects like finite resource, climate, 
socio-economics or urbanisation. This talk is a retro-computing journey across different implementations over time. 
It will focus first on scientific aspects initiated by World3 of the “limit to growth” report and the Gaia hypothesis 
with its related Daisy world.  It will then explore a range of (serious) games 
like STRATAGEM, SimEarth, Balance of Planets, Global Effect, EcoQuest, Anno 2070, Fate of the World...
Different aspects such as code, user interface, model complexity will be put in the perspective of 
the evolution of computer languages and the exponential growth of computation power. 
It will conclude with some thoughts based on the emerging global picture in the context of the challenges 
our world is currently facing.

## System Dynamics related

### Limit to Growth (World3)

Year: circa 1970 (for model, DYNAMO OLDER)
Language: DYNAMO, evolution of SIMPLE, pure text (later enriched with graphical language STELLA)
IBM mainframe (initially on punch card) then ported to mini and micro, implemented in ASM then FORTRAN
approach: code generation, low/no code already (textual then graphical) to be used by non computer programmers

documentation:

### STRATAGEM (serious game)

PC-BASIC, see [code here](STRATAGEM/stratagm.bas)
Microcomputer (IBM-PC)

Documentation:
* 1985 paper
* about Kondratieff waves

## Games
